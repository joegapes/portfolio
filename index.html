    <p>
      I'm 15 years old and originally started making games in Roblox Studio. I was pretty good at building and designing cool stuff, but I always felt kind of limited when i found out about VR. That all changed after I discovered <em>Gorilla Tag</em> — with its Unique locomotion that i loved at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious and motivated, I searched up “how to make a Gorilla Tag fan game” on YouTube, downloaded Unity, and jumped right in. After following a tutorial, I had my very first working VR game. The only problem? I was a complete newbie at Unity
    </p>

      That's when I talked to Gambs — real pro He helped me out a <strong>ton</strong> and kept me going when things got hard.  Without him, I probably would've gone back to Roblox. But instead, I pushed forward, got better at Unity, and started learning C# (somewhat)...

      Now, I’m building VR games, heh... lets just say.. I’m just getting started.
